For deep learning, when we running a deep learning model on our own laptop we can choose CPU or GPU to process the deep learning task.

Although they all can process the task perfectly, but speed difference come into existence when using CPU, GPU:

GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) generally outperform CPUs (Central Processing Units) in deep learning tasks due to fundamental differences in their design and architecture, which make GPUs more efficient at processing large amounts of data in parallel.

Therefore when we change the bash size of the GPU, the speed will also change:

Increasing the batch size can initially speed up data processing because it reduces the frequency of data transfers between the CPU and GPU, allowing the GPU to take full advantage of its parallel processing capabilities. A larger batch means the GPU can work at full capacity for longer periods, minimizing the overhead associated with starting and stopping tasks. That is why if we increase the bash size from 16 to (32 or 64), the speed will increase. However, when the batch size becomes too large, excessively large batch sizes can strain GPU resources, leading to inefficiencies and slowdowns. When the batch size exceeds the GPU's memory capacity, it necessitates frequent data shuttling, increasing system overhead. This can also force the system into paging or swapping, significantly delaying data movement. Concurrently, the CPU may lag in data preprocessing due to the volume, causing pipeline stalls. Additionally, an overloaded GPU might experience computation delays as its cores await data. Moreover, high power consumption from processing large batches can cause overheating, prompting the GPU to throttle back to prevent damage if cooling is insufficient. These issues emphasize the need for optimizing batch size to ensure smooth and efficient GPU operation.
