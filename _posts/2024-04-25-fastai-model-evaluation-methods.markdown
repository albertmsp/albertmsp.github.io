There are many ways for us to evaluate the deep learning model, for the fastai models, there are two ways: confusion matrix and t_SNE

For confusion matrix:
Confusion matrix is a tool often used in classification to visualize the performance of an algorithm. Each row of the matrix represents the instances in an actual class, while each column represents the instances in a predicted class. This allows you to see where the model might be confusing two classes and is useful for identifying misclassifications.
